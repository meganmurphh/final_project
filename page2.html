	<h1> Deciding What to Do </h1>
		<p> 
			There were many options and career paths for me to choose from. For a 
			majority of high school, I was set on becoming a veterinarian. But did I really 
			want to spend the next 40 years of putting down dogs and relaying bad news to 
			hopeful pet owners? Turns out, the "boring" and "miserable" cubicle jobs my 
			friends all spent their time avoiding seemed to be exactly what I was looking 
			for.
			</p>
		<p>
			After deciding that veterinary school wasn't for me, I scrambled to find the 
			next best thing. What was I interested in? What do I want to do for the rest 
			of my life? A daunting question asked to any 17 year old.
			</p>
		<p>
			I would scroll through career listing websites for hours and took numerous 
			career placing tests, but none of the listings ever caught my eye. Close to 
			giving up hope, I took one last career test. This time I decided to answer the 
			questions with what I really wanted, instead of basing my answers off what my 
			parents told me, or what I thought would make good income. I finished the quiz,
			 and in my top three matches appeared: <em>Software Programmer</em>
			 </p>
		<p>
			Interested, I clicked to learn more. Could I really do this? I thought to 
			myself as I read the <a href="https://www.herzing.edu/description/computer-programmer">
			job description.</a> As I kept reading, it seemed to get 
			more interesting, especially as my eyes caught the listed <a href=
			"https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/computer-programmer/salary">salary.
			</a><em>And a good salary?</em> I was hooked. I searched Mizzou's list of 
			majors to find computer science. Sure enough, I had finally found something 
			I could see myself doing.
