	<h1>Moving to Mizzou</h1>
		<p>
			Come late September, I finally recieved an email regarding my fate at Mizzou. 
			Accepted. I couldn't believe it. <b>I'm going to Mizzou.</b> My top school. My 
			<em>dream</em> school.
			</p>
		<p>
			While I was excited to go to Mizzou, I did put off a lot of the incoming 
			freshman deadlines. As my senior year went on, they seemed to sneak up on me,
			and I would often find myself rushing to beat the deadline.
			</p>
		<p>
			In early January, I started to panick as I realized the window to find a 
			roommate was rapidly closing, as the deadline was <b>February 1st.</b> I 
			frantically messaged people on Facebook trying to find a match. It wasn't 
			until late January when I finally made my decision. With little to no luck in 
			finding anyone, a girl that I had talked to earlier in the month reached back 
			out to me and asked to be roommates. Desperate and trying to avoid a random 
			assignment at all costs, I hastily said yes.
			</p>
		<p>
			After I had found a roommate, the next thing to do was look for furniture. I 
			was so excited to finally be able to pick out my own things now that I was 
			going to live on my own. I made numerous lists describing the things that I 
			needed, and the things that I thought that I needed. Needless to say, <b>it 
			was a lot of stuff.</b> More than I had expected.
			</p>
		<p>
			When move-in day had finally arrived, I found myself ill-prepared, and panic 
			mode set in when I realized that really only had half of what I needed. I was 
			mad at myself for not taking my move seriously.
