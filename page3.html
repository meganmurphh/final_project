	<h1> Committing to Mizzou </h1>
		<p> 
			After a quick switch from computer science to IT, I had finally figured out what 
			I wanted to do, or so I thought. I had never coded before, and while the thought 
			of coding interested me, but also frightened me at the same time. It seemed hard. 
			Almost too hard. But I knew that I would try.
			</p>
		<p>
			Come senior year, it was time to submit my college applications. With a good 
			ACT score and a lot of determination, I submitted my application to Mizzou. 
			I remember my heart racing as I hit the submit button. <em>What if I don't 
			get in?</em> It was hard thinking about rejection from my top school. The 
			school that I had been dreaming about for most of my childhood.
			</p>
		<p>
			For weeks after I submitted my application, I would constantly get the 
			question, "So what <b>schools</b> did you apply to?" Accompanied by a 
			disapproving, or confusing look when I answered with just the one. 
			"That's it?" They would say. How could I waste my time applying to other 
			schools when there was only one school that I <em>truly</em> wanted to be at?
