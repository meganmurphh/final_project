	<h1>Work that I'm Most Proud of</h1>
		<p>
			It still amazes me that I am able to do so many things with a computer, 
			especially since my mind was set on the fact that IT was going to be too hard 
			for me. The following block of code is from a python project that I submitted 
			for my IT 1040 class. I'm proud of this code because it was one of the most
			difficult assignments I've done for the class, and I'm proud because I was
			able to overcome obstacles and submit a working program that reads a <code>.csv
			</code>file and parses through it to provide data.
			</p>

	While this code may look messy to someone more advanced in this topic, I'm proud to 
	say that I was able to create something like this and hope that someday I'll be able 
	to create something that is actually useful to someone, something that improves 
	everyday life.
