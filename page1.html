				You could say that my facination with Mizzou originated within my family. 
				Since both my parents, uncles, and grandpa are all alumnis. Mizzou football games, 
				tailgates, and visits to the columns have all been frequent family activities since 
				I could practically walk. Being hoisted up onto the columns by my dad was something 
				I most looked forward to when visiting, along with our routine trip to Shakespeares.

					was only one to apply to.
